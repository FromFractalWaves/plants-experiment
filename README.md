# C-Plants: Geometric Computational Growth Simulation

## Overview

C-Plants is an interactive simulation that models plant growth using principles from the Computational Spacetime (C-Space) Framework. This application demonstrates how plants can be modeled as navigators through a geometric computational manifold, optimizing their growth patterns based on resources, constraints, and environmental factors.

The simulation visualizes how plants use various tropisms (directional growth responses) to navigate their environment, seeking light, water, and structural support while avoiding obstacles - all framed within the theoretical C-Space paradigm.

## Key Concepts

### Plants as C-Space Navigators

C-Plants represents plants as entities that:

1. **Navigate a Computational Manifold**: Plants move through a geometric space where distances, paths, and complexity are defined by mathematical relations.

2. **Follow Tropism Principles**: Plants exhibit:
   - **Phototropism**: Growth toward light sources
   - **Gravitropism**: Response to gravity (stems grow up, roots down)
   - **Hydrotropism**: Growth toward water
   - **Thigmotropism**: Response to physical touch (wrapping around supports)

3. **Balance Energy-Coherence Dynamics**: Plants maintain structural integrity (coherence) while optimizing for energy acquisition, managing:
   - **Coherence (H)**: Structural organization and stability
   - **Distortion (D)**: Environmental or internal instability
   - **Temporal Complexity (T)**: Rate of growth or procedural evolution
   - **Spatial Complexity (S)**: Structural organization in 3D space

### C-Space Framework Integration

The simulation applies advanced concepts from the C-Space theoretical framework:

- **Complex Density**: Combines spatial complexity, temporal complexity, and energy into a unified measure
- **Perpendicular Dynamics**: Models coherence and emergent time as orthogonal processes
- **Hierarchical Infinity**: Allows recursive branching patterns through layered dimensional spaces
- **Singularity Handling**: Manages computational breakdowns through "pure time states"

## Controls & Interaction

### Placing Environmental Elements

- **Left Click**: Add a light source (sun/lamp)
- **Middle Click**: Add a water source
- **Right Click**: Add an obstacle
- **S Key**: Add a support structure (trellis/stake)

### Manipulating Plant Growth

- **G Key**: Force growth at the most energetic node
- **B Key**: Force branching on a suitable node
- **R Key**: Reset the simulation
- **Space Key**: Pause/resume the simulation

### Display Options

- **C Key**: Toggle complexity heatmap
- **D Key**: Toggle debug information
- **+/-**: Increase/decrease simulation speed

## Plant Behaviors

Plants in the simulation exhibit complex emergent behaviors:

1. **Resource-Seeking Growth**: Plants direct their growth toward light and water sources.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Plants grow around obstacles by increasing distortion and changing direction.

3. **Life Stages**: Plants progress through seedling, growing, mature, and flowering stages.

4. **Leaf & Flower Generation**: Mature, stable branches generate leaves and flowers based on energy levels.

5. **Efficiency Optimization**: Plants naturally follow optimal paths (geodesics) through the space.

6. **Branching Patterns**: The distortion parameter triggers branching when a stem becomes unstable.

7. **Water Management**: Plants track water levels, consuming water for growth and seeking new sources when depleted.

## Technical Details

C-Plants is built with:

- **Python** and **Pygame** for the simulation engine and visualization
- **NumPy** for mathematical operations and vector calculations
- **Object-Oriented** design with dataclasses for efficient entity representation

The core architecture includes:

- **PlantCSpaceEngine**: The main simulation engine implementing C-Space mechanics
- **PlantNodeEnhanced**: Individual plant segments with properties and behaviors
- **EnhancedPlantRenderer**: Realistic visualization of plants with dynamic effects
- **SimulationControls**: User interface and interaction handling

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Running the Simulation**:
   ```
   python plant_app/main.py
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   The initial screen allows customization of parameters like growth rate, branch probability, and maximum nodes.

## Conceptual Foundations

C-Plants bridges botany, computational geometry, and theoretical physics, demonstrating how:

- Biological systems can be modeled as navigators through computational spaces
- Spatial-temporal processes exhibit geometric properties
- Complex adaptive systems balance organization (coherence) and disorder (distortion)
- Resource-constrained growth follows optimal paths through manifolds

This simulation provides an interactive window into the Computational Spacetime framework, showcasing principles of emergence, optimization, and geometric navigation in a visually intuitive plant-growth model.
