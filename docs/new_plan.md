Why a Pipeline Matters

    Plants: Different species or growth patterns (e.g., vines vs. trees) need unique traitsâ€”branching rules, tropism strengths, or energy thresholds. A pipeline lets you plug in new ones without rewriting core logic.
    Environment: Lights, water, obstacles, and supports drive growth, but you might want wind, soil quality, or predators later. A modular system keeps it extensible.
    C-Space: Your theory thrives on tweaking parameters (H, D, T, S). A pipeline makes it easy to test how new factors warp the computational manifold.
